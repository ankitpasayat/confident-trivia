# Confident Trivia - Game Rules

## Objective

**Win by scoring the most points after 10 questions.**

## Game Components

- **Question Cards:** Trivia questions with multiple choice answers
- **Player Whiteboards:** One per player (or paper/notepads)
- **Voting Tokens:** Each player receives 10 numbered tokens (1-10) in their chosen color
- **Answer Mat:** Central playing surface for placing tokens (optional - can use table)

## Setup

1. Each player selects a color and takes:
   - 1 whiteboard
   - 10 voting tokens numbered 1-10 in their color

2. Determine the first **Question Reader:**
   - Choose randomly (youngest player, roll dice, etc.)
   - The role rotates clockwise after each round

3. The game lasts **10 questions** (one complete use of all tokens)

## How to Play

### Each Round

1. **Question Phase**
   - The Question Reader reads a card out loud
   - **Important:** Do not take the card out of the box while reading
   - All players consider the question and possible answers

2. **Voting Phase**
   - Starting with the player to the Question Reader's left, each player places **one voting token face down** on the mat
   - Players choose their token based on confidence level:
     - **High number (8-10)** = High confidence in your answer
     - **Medium number (4-7)** = Moderate confidence
     - **Low number (1-3)** = Low confidence or educated guess
   - Each token can only be played once per game

3. **Reveal Phase**
   - After all players have placed their tokens, they are revealed simultaneously
   - The Question Reader announces the correct answer

4. **Scoring Phase**
   - **If you were RIGHT:** Move your token to your personal scoring pile
   - **If you were WRONG:** Your token is permanently discarded
   - The Question Reader role moves clockwise to the next player

## Strategy Tips

- **Risk Management:** Save high-value tokens for questions where you're most confident
- **Token Conservation:** Remember, each token can only be used once
- **Spread Your Bets:** Balance high and low confidence plays throughout the game
- **Know Your Limits:** It's better to play a low token correctly than lose a high token on a guess

## Ending the Game

- After 10 questions, all players will have used all their tokens
- Players add up the numbers on the tokens in their scoring pile
- **The player with the highest total wins!**

## Tie Breaker

If two or more players tie for the highest score:
- The tied player with the highest single token in their scoring pile wins
- If still tied, those players share the victory

## Game Variants

### Quick Play (Optional)
Play 5 questions instead of 10:
- Each player uses 5 tokens of their choice
- Keep the remaining 5 tokens aside

### Expert Mode (Optional)
- Players must write their reasoning on their whiteboard before placing tokens
- Adds discussion element after reveals
